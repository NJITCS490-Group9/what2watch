## Motivation of the app:

- Have you and friends ever ran into a problem where you all cannot figure out what you want to watch? Well, we created this perfect app for you and your friends watch a      perfect thing.

## Why this app is unique:

- We aim to deliver a web app that allows groups of people to vote on a movie genre to watch together and get Netflix movies and accompanying trailers based on the popular   vote. The app will provide a social login through Google to allow users to easily identify themselves, allow the host to optionally filter out unwanted genres, and implement a live chat feature for the host and guests during the genre voting process.

## How to use the app:

- You and your frinds simply just logon to the app together using your google account and choose who the host will be for the app.
- You would wait until the host is done setting up the app and then you will directed into the genre screen.
- Once you pick what genre you want to watch tonight, you and your host will be directed into the results screen where our app will pick out the movie for you.
- You can see the winning Genre of the movie, the movie and also the trailer.
- On the other hand you can also simultaneously chat with your friends while being on the app.
- Once the host confimrs the movie, everyone will get a pop up where and what time you all will be watching the movie. 
- Happy picking and watch!
